Assumes Autostar sonar sensors are used, along with AdvantageTMS Longrange and Kickplate Sonars. 
Requires 12V source switched on to power sonars.

   Sonar Ultrasonic Long Range calibration tool.

Assumes Adafruit-RGB-LCD-Shield-Library

Do a Ultrasonic Sonar measurement and print it to the display.
Continuosly measure the distance and compare if the measured distance stays within a tolerance.
After a defined number of measurements with all distances within tolerance the sonar is stated ok.
 The circuit is described in a schematic document.
 The display pulls In/Out 10 to a voltage level. Out 10 must be separated from the display shield,
 otherwise the sonar measurement on Input 10 doesent work and will allways return 0.

     June 2018    V. 1.6: Changed speed of sound from 340m/s to 343m/s as this is what is assumed by the GenX+ Prox Code - JDS
                           Added in different LCD Screen functionality back in - JDS
                           Changed GPIO Ports to fit the default ports used in test fixture - JDS
     June 2018    V. 1.42: Ringing time must be below 2100 ms. Decreased margin. Several sonars calibrated show, that there would be massive amount of bad sonars.
                           In production the sonars with 2100 ms acceptance worked fine.
     April 2018   V. 1.41: Check long range sonar ringing time within Proximity board blanking limit of 2.2ms - ringing time must be below 2000ms for margin,
                           Change speed of sound from 333 to 340 m/s - MG 
                           Change pulse Duration from 400us to 300us and 70us to have similar behaviour as procimity board
    January 2018  V. 1.5 : Troubleshooting V2, corrected speed of sound 58kHz Sonar - JDS
    January 2018  V. 1.4 : Added in different LCD Screen - JDS
    December 2017 V. 1.32: Sonar stated ok if 80 measurements of a distance are within 0.5% tolerance
    December 2017 V. 1.30: Calibration of three different sonar types with different characteristics
